            It's excellent if you want to impress some guests — or even yourself. 
            It may be a bit time-consuming, but it's well worth the TLC you put into it.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make pasta: Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water 
            to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. 
            Add spinach, cover, and steam until bright green, about 2 minutes. 
            Squeeze spinach to remove excess moisture and process in a food processor to make a paste. 
            Add semolina, eggs, and salt; process until smooth. 
            Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in enough flour to make a smooth dough. 
            Knead briefly, then cover with a dish towel and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make ragu: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. 
            Cook and stir carrot, celery, onion, and bacon in hot butter until onion is translucent. 
            Stir in pork, beef, and ham; cook and stir until crumbly and browned. 
            Stir in beef stock, tomato paste, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. 
            Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While ragu is simmering, make béchamel: Combine butter and flour in a medium saucepan over 
            medium-low heat. Whisk to make a roux. Remove from heat, let rest for 1 minute, 
            then whisk in warm milk. Return to heat and simmer for 10 minutes, 
            stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat.

        <li>
            Finish ragu: Stir chicken livers into simmering sauce. 
            Cook for 1 minute, remove from heat, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble lasagna: Place 1 pasta sheet in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. 
            Spread 1/3 of the ragu, 1/4 of the béchamel, 1/3 of the ricotta, 
            and 1/4 of the Parmesan over pasta. Repeat layers twice. 
            Top with remaining béchamel and Parmesan; dot with butter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
