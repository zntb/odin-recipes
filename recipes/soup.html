        <p>
            This cream of carrot soup is my little picky eater's favorite soup.  
        </p>     
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter, cubed</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups sliced carrots</li>
        <li>1 large potato, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat. 
            Add carrots, potato, onion, and celery, then stir in chicken broth and ginger. 
            Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. 
            Uncover and cool for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer soup in batches to a food processor; blend until smooth. 
            Return soup to the Dutch oven and stir in cream, curry powder, salt, and pepper. 
            Cook over low heat until heated through, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>
        If the soup is too thick after adding the cream, dilute it with small amounts of water until 
        the desired consistency is reached.

    <p>
        You can also purée the soup in a large bowl using a hand mixer.
