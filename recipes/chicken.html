    <h1>Butterflied Roast Chicken with Lemon and Rosemary</h1>
    <img src="../images/chicken.webp" alt="Image of Lasagne Verdi">
        <p>
            This butterflied roast chicken with lemon and rosemary is tender and juicy, 
            and there's lots of crispy golden skin to enjoy.   
        </p>     
        <p>
            By removing the backbone with a knife or kitchen scissors to flatten the chicken, 
            it cooks quicker and more evenly and the breast meat doesn't dry out. 
            Butterflied chicken is especially good on the grill.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, backbone removed</li>
        <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 lemon, sliced into rounds</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>Â½ cup white wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
            Line a rimmed baking pan with aluminum foil. Place a rack on top of foil. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Rub olive oil on both sides of chicken and generously season with salt and black pepper. 
            Arrange lemon slices and rosemary on the rack and place chicken, 
            skin-side up, onto the rack. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 
            45 to 55 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, 
            near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer chicken to a serving platter and tent a piece of aluminum foil over it. 
            Discard lemon and rosemary and remove rack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour wine into the baking pan and gently loosen the bits of food in the pan with 
            a wooden spoon, being careful not to tear the foil. 
            Strain pan juices into a saucepan and bring to a boil; 
            cook until sauce is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Spoon sauce over chicken.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>Chicken broth can be used in place of white wine.</p>
